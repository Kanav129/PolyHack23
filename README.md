## Project Description

Our solution, Mindwave aims to improve mental health on social media by using AI to collect and analyze user data through distinct key parameters to help aid a more unique and catered solution. We start by using the Instagram API to collect user data, including profile information, posts, interactions and Spotify user activity to gain insights into music tastes. We then extract features from the data, using natural language processing to encode profile information and extract sentiment and readability from posts. We use these features to train machine learning models to predict users' personality traits, interests, mental health states, and social interaction levels. Based on these predictions, we group users with similar attributes and provide a social recommender to recommend new connections within groups. We continuously evaluate and improve the system based on user feedback to provide better recommendations and improve mental health on social media.
